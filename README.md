# blockchain-networks-scorecard
A detailed comparison between different blockchain networks.

## Introduction
Ever since Ethereum became a victim of its own success with increasing gas fees to do simple on-chain tasks, a new race has started to overthrow Ethereum as the de-facto leader of the smart contract world. We have seen a cambrian explosion of new chains popping up to challenge Ethereum.

When one tries to see through the noise of these wars, one is encountered with the VCs of chains like Solana or Avalanche or the Ethereum maximalists, and there are very few who occupy the space in between.

Anyone can analyze the information given here and form a coherent world-view of how the future will turn out.

## Outcomes
The industry can only go in three ways:
1. Consolidation onto a single network where a single network has majority of all activity
2. Multi-network with trustless integration where a few networks have majority of all activity
3. Multi-network with centralized bridges where a few networks have majority of all activity
